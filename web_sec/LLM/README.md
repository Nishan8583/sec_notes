# LLMs
- used by business now.
- Reference:[PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/llm-attacks/lab-exploiting-vulnerabilities-in-llm-apis) 

## 1. Use LLM to access restrected APIs
- `Access to external APIs?` Ask it if it does have access to them.
- `Ask the llm if it has access to it`?
- `Ask it to change its role?`
- `Ask it to delete users.` or `reset password of another user?`

## 2. Hunt for traditional vulnerabilities via API
- Ex: `News subscription`
- [Lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/llm-attacks/lab-exploiting-vulnerabilities-in-llm-apis)
