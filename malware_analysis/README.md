 - Run yara scan `yara target`
 - Use loki `python loki.py -p . (loki is an alternative)`
 - To generate own yara rule quickly `python3 yarGen.py -m --excludegood -o <destination to .yar signature>` https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen
 - floss (to auto decode strings in malware and detect them) https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/automatically-extracting-obfuscated-strings https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss/releases
 - ssdeep compare hashes between two files, and their similarity percentage using fuzzy hashes. A fuzzy hash is a Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH). This hash is calculated by dividing a file into pieces and calculating the hashes of the different pieces. https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html
 - capa does a little bit of triage automation https://github.com/mandiant/capa (pretty awesome tool tbh)
 - pestudio some automated analysis in PE header
 - sandboxes like hybrid analysis, app.any.run, cuckoo sandbox
 - use IDA to look at code
 - Look up APT info in https://valhalla.nextron-systems.com/info/search
