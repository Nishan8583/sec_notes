# Threat intel
<!--StartFragment-->

Threat Intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.

There are different classifications of Threat Intelligence, and the primary types of it are:

*   Strategic Intel: High-level intel that looks into the organisation's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.
*   Technical Intel: Examines evidence and artefacts of attacks an adversary uses. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.
*   Tactical Intel: Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.
*   Operational Intel: Assesses an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that threat actors may target.
