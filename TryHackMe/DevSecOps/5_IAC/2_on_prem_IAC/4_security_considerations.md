# Security Considerations for IaC Pipelines

    Dependencies:
        Issue: Dependencies, such as base images, can introduce vulnerabilities if not managed properly.
        Example: An outdated OS version in an image could lead to security risks.
        Recommendation: Regularly update base images and manage dependencies to minimize vulnerabilities.

    Defaults:
        Issue: Systems often provisioned with default credentials or settings, which can be a security risk if not changed.
        Example: Default credentials like vagrant:vagrant in Windows images or jenkins:jenkins for Jenkins.
        Recommendation: Alter or remove default credentials during the final stages of deployment or ensure they are changed post-deployment.

    Insufficient Hardening:
        Issue: Rapid deployment can result in insufficient hardening of the infrastructure.
        Example: Services like WinRM may remain enabled when not needed, posing a security risk.
        Recommendation: Include hardening steps in the IaC pipeline or perform them manually after deployment.

    Remote Code Execution as a Feature:
        Issue: IaC pipelines execute code that provisions and configures infrastructure, which can be exploited if security is not managed.
        Recommendation:
            Secret Management: Securely store sensitive information to prevent exposure in source code.
            Principle of Least Privilege: Restrict access to the IaC pipeline to only necessary users and services to minimize risk.
