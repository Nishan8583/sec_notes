Infrastructure Before IaC

    Manual tasks:
        Provisioning servers (physical or virtual)
        Network configuration (IP addresses, subnets, routers, switches, firewalls)
        Installing an OS
        Software installation and updates
        Disaster recovery planning and execution

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Explained

    Automates infrastructure tasks through code
    Defines a "desired state" for infrastructure
    Simplifies infrastructure changes (e.g., adding VMs) through code updates
    Eliminates manual requests and delays

Benefits of IaC

    Collaborative & Shared Responsibility:
        Infrastructure configuration knowledge is distributed
        Supports Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
    Scalable:
        Easily scales infrastructure with commands or automation
        Efficient for cloud computing environments
    Versionable:
        Treated as code, tracked via version control
        Facilitates audits, troubleshooting, and rollback to working versions
    Repeatable:
        Ensures consistent infrastructure across multiple environments
        Saves time and improves reliability for testing and production environments

IaC in Practice

    Disaster Recovery:
        Automates provisioning and configuration for backup data centers
        Automates data backup and recovery processes
        Automates failover to backup infrastructure, reducing downtime
        Ensures configuration consistency and avoids misconfigurations
        Scales resources as needed during recovery

Summary

    IaC supports DevSecOps by enabling CI/CD
    Enhances efficiency by automating infrastructure changes
    Reduces manual tasks and adapts quickly to infrastructure needs
