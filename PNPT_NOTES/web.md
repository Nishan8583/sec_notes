# Enumeration
 - `assetfinder` is great for finding subdomains. `assetfinder domain.com`. `--subs-only` if u want related only.
 - `amass enum -d domain.com`
 - `cat domains | httprobe -s -p https:443` to ensure the domain is alive.
 - test, dev, admin domain would be interesting.
 - `gowitness` screenshot of website, wohoooo. https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness .
 - The script https://pastebin.com/MhE6zXVt
 - Use the excel checklist as well [OWASP LINK](https://github.com/tanprathan/OWASP-Testing-Checklist) . Added here [CheckList](OWASP_WSTG_Checklist.xlsx).

    - [WordlistFromSource](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Source2URL/blob/master/Source2URL).If you have the source code.
    - Does it have a docker image, look inside for extra info, source code?
    - Try to get a demo.
    - [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau) fetch historic URL.
    - [waymore](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore) like gau, but gives extra info.
