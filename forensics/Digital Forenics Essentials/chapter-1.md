# Chapter-1
- Computer forensics is a part of digital forensics that deals with crimes committed across computing devices such as networks, computers, and digital storage media.
- Objectives of Computer Forensics:
         Identify, gather, and preserve the evidence of a cybercrime
         Identify and gather evidence of cybercrimes in a forensically sound manner
         Track and prosecute the perpetrators in a court of law
         Interpret, document, and present the evidence such that it is admissible during
        prosecution
         Estimate the potential impact of malicious activity on the victim and assess the intent of
        the perpetrator
         Find vulnerabilities and security loopholes that help attackers
         Understand the techniques and methods used by attackers to avert prosecution and
        overcome them
         Recover deleted files, hidden files, and temporary data that can be used as evidence
         Perform incident response (IR) to prevent further loss of intellectual property, finances,
        and reputation during an attack
         Know the laws of various regions and areas, as digital crimes are widespread and remote
         Know the process of handling multiple platforms, data types, and operating systems
         Learn to identify and use the appropriate tools for forensic investigations
         Prepare for incidents in advance to ensure the integrity and continuity of network
        infrastructure
         Offer ample protection to data resources and ensure regulatory compliance
         Protect the organization from similar incidents in the future
         Help counteract online crimes such as abuse, bullying, and reputation damage
         Minimize the tangible and intangible losses to an organization or an individual
         Support the prosecution of the perpetrator of a cybercrime

Espionage: Corporate espionage is a central threat to organizations because competitors often attempt to secure sensitive data through open-source intelligence gathering. Through this approach, competitors can launch similar products in the market, alter prices, and generally undermine the market position of a target organization.
